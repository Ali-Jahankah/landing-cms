# Overview

#### This is a **Next.js** project that uses **Contentful as a CMS** and **Tailwind CSS** for styling. The landing page is fully optimized for **SEO, performance, and accessibility**. The project is deployed on **Vercel** for efficient hosting.

<br>

# Architecture and Efficiency

#### - **Next.js (v15.1.6)** was chosen for **server-side rendering (SSR) and static site generation (SSG)** to ensure fast loading times and **better SEO**.

#### - **Contentful** is used as the headless CMS for managing dynamic content easily.

#### - **Tailwind CSS** was used for quick styling, responsiveness, and performance optimization.

#### - **Lazy loading** is implemented to improve page speed.

#### - **Next.js `<Image />` component** is used for optimized images, automatic resizing, and lazy loading.

#### - **Environment variables (.env.local)** are used to keep API keys and sensitive data secure.

#### - The project is **responsive** and **tested on Chrome and Safari**.

#### - **Buttons and links are currently static** since this is a landing page, but the app can be expanded with additional features.

<br>

The app will run at `http://localhost:3000`.

<br>

## [Live Demo](https://landing-cms-kappa.vercel.app/)

<br>

# Further Improvements

As a Full-Stack JavaScript Developer, I can implement further improvements upon request and given more development time, such as:

- **Dockerizing the app to ensure simplify deployments, and improve scalability**.
- **Implementing GitHub Actions pipelines for automated builds, and deployments**.
- **Optimizing additional media types like videos to enhance performance and reduce load times**.
- **Adding animations, more pages, forms, and form validations to improve user experience and interactivity**.
